Why a React Framework and not any other easy to use blogging platform ?

Firstly, I know nothing about this, not a single thing. I just forked a boilerplate and started writing this. Because is the motive of this entire thing is that I don't wanna care about anything and just focus on writing.

Then you might ask why this fancy thing Maitra ?

1. To flex that you're a developer ?
2. To just increase the green dots on your GitHub ?
3. Are you too posh to use blogger or notion or anything else like them ?

Umm, no. I do have a blog on Notion, it's just too goodd !!! But the biggest problem with it is

# S E O

Yes, there is ZERO SEO on it. I personally love writing stuff, I don't expect to earn money from it but I do want people to read it. If someone googles my name then I want it to show up.
React apps in general have good seo without doing seo, my random test projects show up in google search.

Now you're next question might be then why not NEXT JS ? It's trending, it has strong future and crazy strong seo. One word answer - **laziness** . NextJS is good but its a bit complex and my motive is to right now focus on writing only.
